# ViT

ViT is a whitty plugin for Vim LaTeX support!  This project is in an incredibly early stage,
 don't rely on it in any way and don't expect anything of it. Changes are made to my whim,
or vim...  I'll see myself out. But really, this project is basically an efficiency tool for
myself, so if you want to use it that is on you.

## How to Install

Using ``vim-plug`` the process is quite easy, just add this to your ``.vimrc``:
```vimscript
call plug#begin('path-to-plugin-directory')
Plug 'MarcelSimader/ViT'
call plug#end()
```

## How to Contribute

I have no idea to be honest.

## Other Notes

This plugin is intended mainly for typesetting mathematics in LaTeX. It is meant as
general LaTeX filetype plugin, and it probably does not work well for ``.cls`` or ``.sty``
files.

ViT is distributed under the Vim license. See the LICENSE file or ``:h license`` inside Vim.
