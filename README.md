# VimTeXtended

It means Vim with eXtended (ektended?) TeX -- Don't make fun of the name!  This project is
in an incredibly early stage, don't rely on it in any way and don't expect anything of it.
Changes are made to my whim, or vim...  I'll see myself out.

## How to Install

Using ``plugged`` the process is quite easy, just add this to your ``.vimrc``:
```vimscript
call plug#begin('path-to-plugin-directory')
Plug 'MarcelSimader/vimtextended'
call plug#end()
```

## How to Contribute

I have no idea to be honest.

## Other Notes

This plugin is intended mainly for typesetting mathematics in LaTeX. It is meant as
general LaTeX filetype plugin, and it probably does not work well for ``.cls`` or ``.sty``
files.

inside Vim.
