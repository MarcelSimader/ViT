# VimTeXtended

It means Vim with eXtended (ektended?) TeX -- Don't make fun of the name!
This project is in an incredibly early stage, don't rely on it in any way
and don't expect anything of it. Changes are made to my whim, or vim...
I'll see myself out.

## How to Contribute

I have no idea to be honest.

## Other Notes

This plugin is intended mainly for typesetting mathematics in LaTeX. It is
meant as general LaTeX filetype plugin, and it porbably does not work well
for ``.cls`` or ``.sty`` files.
